UPC codes are used by Amazon to identify products in their database, and if you are adding a new unique listing, <strong>you need a unique UPC code<\/strong>. \u00a0Remember that each unique item needs a unique UPC, for example:<br \/>\n&#8211; If you&#8217;re selling T-Shirts, each unique Color will need a unique UPC. \u00a0If you have 20 Black, 20 White, and 20 Green for sale, you&#8217;ll need 3 unique UPC codes, 1 for each unique Color.<\/p>\n<p>Amazon requires a universal product code in order to prevent duplicate products being on different listings and to prevent counterfeit items from being sold on their platform.\u00a0 They serve an important role in maintaining and tracking inventory across millions of products.<\/p>\n<p><b>All of the codes we sell at UPCs.com will work on Amazon, guaranteed!
