Amazon has a brand registry. A Brand Registry on Amazon helps protect the seller&#8217;s intellectual property and provide a trusted experience for Amazon customers.<\/p>\n<p>With Brand Registry involved, this error could be 1 of 2 things;<\/p>\n<p>1: You are attempting to use the barcode on an item that has its brand registered on Amazon.<br \/>\n2: You\/your company is enrolled in Amazon Brand Registry and the codes you entered are not licensed by your company from GS1.<\/p>\n<p>A common solution to number 1 is &#8211; from the <em>brand field<\/em> change the brand&#8217;s name to your Amazon company name (DBA) and put the brand&#8217;s name in the item description.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you are trying to list an iPhone, instead of putting <em>Apple<\/em> in the brand field, enter your Amazon company name and input the brand name of the iPhone, Apple in the item description.<\/p>\n<p>As for number 2, if you or your company is with Amazon&#8217;s Brand-Registry program, you should know that it has a set of rules different from the rest of Amazon&#8217;s. For product IDs, you may try to file for an exemption to disregard the use of GTINs as an identifier to your product.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/upcs.com\/blog\/you-are-using-upcs-eans-isbns-asins-or-jan-codes-amazon\/\">Please find more information on how to resolve this error on our help page here.<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>ERROR:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>&#8220;You may not create ASINs for this brand. Please review our ASIN Creation Policy here: <a href=\"https:\/\/sellercentral.amazon.com\/gp\/help\/201844590\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https:\/\/sellercentral.amazon.com\/gp\/help\/201844590<\/a> .&#8221;<\/em><\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This is an issue similar to that of the first error and is once again related to Brand-Registry. Follow the solution above and it should resolve the issue.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>PRODUCT ID: The value specified is invalid.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This can happen for a number of reasons. To identify which causes this, make sure to do the following,<\/p>\n<p>1. Make sure that the codes you entered are complete and do not have spaces\/gaps\/dashes in between each number.<br \/>\n2. Make sure to select the right format.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If 14 digits, select GTIN\/GTIN-14.<\/li>\n<li>If 13 digits, select EAN.<\/li>\n<li>If 12 digits, select UPC.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>ERROR: <\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>&#8220;Sorry, this product is ineligible for Amazon Marketplace selling at this time.&#8221;<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This happens if you attempt to list a product using a UPC\/EAN barcode that is tied to an existing item\/ASIN and in a category that Amazon does not approve for you to sell in. Double-check that the codes you entered are correct and you&#8217;ve never used it to list your other products.<\/p>\n<p>The following error has the same explanation and solution.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"heading\"><strong>ERROR: <\/strong><em>&#8220;The value [ _ ] specified cannot be used as it conflicts with the value [ _ ] for ASIN[ _ ] in the Amazon catalog. If this is ASIN [ _ ], update the value to match the ASIN data. If this is a different product, update identifying information (UPC\/EAN\/Part Number\/etc.).&#8221;<\/em><\/li>\n<li class=\"heading\"><strong>ERROR: <\/strong><em>&#8220;The SKU data provided conflicts with the Amazon catalog.&#8221;<\/em><\/li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"heading\"><strong>ERROR: <\/strong><em>&#8220;<\/em><em>The SKU data provided is different from what&#8217;s already in the Amazon catalog.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>MANUFACTURER PART NUMBER:<\/strong><em> The value [ _ ] specified cannot be used as it conflicts with the value [ _ ] for ASIN[ _ ] in the Amazon catalog.<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you encounter any of these errors, it could mean that you have already listed a product using the same code (the code in error) or another seller has illegally listed products using your unique codes. Note that SnapUPC provides legitimate codes that are guaranteed to have never been assigned\/reassigned to anyone else. If you run into any of these, do the following:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"heading\">Make sure to not use the same UPC\/EAN\/GTIN numbers for different listings.<\/li>\n<li>If you bought the codes from us, please contact us by sending us a screenshot of the error.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>There are other common Amazon errors out there that a seller could potentially encounter and it is always better to reach out to your barcode provider before taking it to Amazon support. Amazon has a strong view of obtaining your UPC\/EAN\/GTIN directly from GS1. And although we understand their concerns, this does not entirely mean that their claims of concerns against your codes are entirely true. It should be known that Amazon has joined the GS1 Board of Governors in 2016 so it makes sense why they would always recommend that you obtain codes from GS1. Also know that Amazon can discriminate accounts if they desire, regardless of your legal ownership of GTIN&#8217;s.<\/p>\n<p>In conclusion, listing a product on Amazon can be a walk in the park but there is also a slim chance that you could run into any of the errors listed above. Obtaining your codes directly from a legitimate provider can save you time and money. At SnapUPC, you can be sure that you are getting legitimate codes and our service is available to help you anytime 24\/7.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It is important to buy your barcodes from a legitimate barcode provider because there are a lot of issues that can arise down the road if you buy illegitimate codes.
